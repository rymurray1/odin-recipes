        <h2> Yakitori Grilled Chicken Skewers</h2>
        <p> 
            Yakitori chicken skewers are a nice and easy way to 
            cook chicken. They are fun and delicious and the whole family
            is sure to love them. You will need a few things in addition
            to the main ingredients, including a large bowl, a dish 
            for soaking and skewers to be soaked for at least an hour
            before you start your grilling.

        <H3> Ingredients</H3>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 pound chicken livers, gizzards or boneless thigh meat</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark soy sauce or tamari</li> 
            <li>1/4 cup mirin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sake or dry sherry</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar            </li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>Scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut chicken into one-inch pieces and place in a shallow dish.</li>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce or tamari, mirin, sake or 
                sherry, brown sugar, garlic and ginger. Bring to a simmer and cook 
                for 7 minutes, until thickened. Reserve 2 tablespoons sauce for 
                serving. Pour remaining sauce over chicken, cover, and chill for 
                at least one hour (and up to 4 hours).
            </li>
            <li>If using wooden or bamboo skewers, soak them in water for one hour.
                Preheat grill or broiler. Thread chicken pieces onto skewers, and
                grill or broil, turning halfway, for about 3 minutes for livers,
                10 minutes for gizzards and 6 minutes for thighs. Serve drizzled
                with reserved sauce and garnished with scallions.
