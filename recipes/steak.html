        <p> 
            Yakitori chicken skewers are a nice and easy way to 
            cook chicken. They are fun and delicious and the whole family
            is sure to love them. You will need a few things in addition
            to the main ingredients, including a large bowl, a dish 
            for soaking and skewers to be soaked for at least an hour
            before you start your grilling.

        <H3> Ingredients</H3>
        <ul> 
            <li>2 Beef Steaks</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of olive oil</li> 
            <li>1 Teaspoon of Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 Tablespoon of black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of white pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of softened butter</li>
            <li>1-2 cloves of minced garlice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove steaks from refrigerator and any packaging and let sit at 
                room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Rub each side with the olive oil to coat. Combine the salt, pepper,
                and white pepper in a small bowl. Rub both sides of each steak with
                the rub mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Preheat a heavy, oven-safe skillet over
                high heat until it is smoking hot. Sear steaks in the hot pan for
                2-3 minutes per side. If the steak has a side of fat, turn the 
                steak onto its side and render the fat by searing it for 2-3 minutes
                as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slide the skillet with the seared steaks in it into the oven to 
                finish cooking. Remove the steaks from the oven 5 degrees before
                the desired level of doneness is achieved, or 130 degrees F for 
                medium rare.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the steaks are cooking, use a fork to combine the butter 
                with garlic in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the steaks are removed from the oven immediately top with
                1 tablespoon of the butter mixture and allow the steaks to 
                rest 10 minutes before cutting into them. The temperature of
                the steak will continue to rise as it rests by about 5 degrees.
